# wdi-project-1
My first game project at WDI in London

#Intro
This is my first game on WDI London. It is an educational game, to learn addition and subtraction. It was based on an interactive game that I used to play with students at the school where I used to teach.

#How to play
A target number is set by the computer, and using the buttons on the screen, you need to reach the target number using either addition or subtraction, in the time specified.

#What went well
This was my first ever project using HTML, CSS and / or Javascript. I grasped the concepts of Javascript well, and am pleased with the functions and my understanding of the logic of the game.

#What I found challenging
at first, it was difficult to graspt the logic, as the comupter had to generate the target number from the options it provided. It therefore relied on sequential functions which was difficult.

#Languages used
CSS3, HTML5, Javascript, [Jquery](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.js).

#Other attributes
I got my fonts from: [Google fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat:300,400,500,700,800).

I got my animations from: [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/).

#Credits
Thank you to the tutors and TAs at General Assembly who supported me in this project.
